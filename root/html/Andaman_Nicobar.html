It’s rich emerald waters, pristine beaches, lush tropical forests, mangroves, tribal cultures and rich diversity in terms of people, food, forests, flora, fauna and landscapes make it an archipelago of unparalleled beauty. People visit these islands to snorkel or scuba dive or just to enjoy a relaxing beach holiday in a budget tropical island paradise. I have been privileged to have explored this island at length many times in the past and am delighted to share its beauty with you through these travel photos. I hope these photographs entice you to plan your upcoming holiday to this tropical archipelago wonder.
